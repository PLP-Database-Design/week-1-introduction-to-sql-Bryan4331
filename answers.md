1. a. Database Engine: Core component that stores, retrieves, and processes data
Database Schema: Defines the structure and organization of the database.

2. A relational database organizes data into tables (rows and columns) with relationships between them, making it easy to retrieve and manage data.

3. Data Definition Language (DDL)
-Defines and modifies database structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
Data Manipulation Language (DML)
-Manages data within tables (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT).
-Data Control Language (DCL)
Manages user permissions (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).

4. Primary Key:
-Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
-Cannot have duplicate or null values.
Foreign Key:
-Links one table to another by referencing the Primary Key of the related table.
-Allows duplicate and null values (unless specified otherwise).

5. An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of a databaseâ€™s structure. It shows entities (tables), their attributes (columns), and the relationships between them, helping to design or understand the database.

6. Advantages of Relational Databases:
Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency through constraints like primary and foreign keys.
Flexibility: Easy to modify the structure (tables, columns) without affecting data.
Scalability: Handles large amounts of data and users efficiently.
Querying: Powerful querying with SQL to retrieve and manipulate data.
Security: Advanced access controls and data protection features

7. INT: Stores integer (whole number) values.
VARCHAR: Stores variable-length text or strings.
DATE: Stores date values (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
FLOAT: Stores decimal numbers or floating-point values.

8. The purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS) is to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently while ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency. It provides a structured way to interact with data, supporting multiple users and complex queries.
